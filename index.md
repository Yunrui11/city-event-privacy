# Privacy Policy – City‑Event Concierge GPT

**Last updated:** 26 May 2025

This GPT reads your chat messages to:
1. Call the Ticketmaster Discovery API and return public event listings.
2. (If you ask for places) perform a real‑time web search and show links.

We do **not**:
- Store personal data such as names, e‑mail addresses, or payment details.
- Share your chat content or location with third parties.
- Use cookies or trackers.

OpenAI retains transient chat logs per its standard policy.  
Ticketmaster requests include only the city, keyword, and dates you provide; no personal identifiers are sent.

If you have questions, contact yunrui@example.com.
